Presentation
============

This document is intended to be a presentation and a user guide to
`MOSP <https://github.com/NC3-LU/MOSP>`_, a platform to create, edit and share valid
JSON objects.

MOSP supports any kind of JSON objects, you just have to specify a JSON schema.
The instance `objects.monarc.lu <https://objects.monarc.lu/>`_ is operated by CASES.
It is dedicated to gather security related objects, in the first place aimed to be used
with MONARC.

Objects officially provided by the MONARC project are available here.
Note that any object created with a JSON schema provided by the MONARC project will be
compatible with the MONARC software. In other words, you can use our JSON schemas in
order to create objects (standards, mapping, etc.) for a usage in your own security
analysis.
