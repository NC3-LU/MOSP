Using the platform
==================

Creating a new object
---------------------

When creating a new object with MOSP you have to:

- choose a JSON schema from the ones available on the platform;
- specify a name and a brief description;
- choose an owning organization (a user account can be bound to one or multiple organizations);
- choose at least one license from the proposed.

You can use any available schemas in order to create shareable JSON objects.


Select a schema

Edit object definition
----------------------


The form above is generated thanks to the JSON schema. Using this form ensures that you
will create valid objects.

If you update the schema related to an already defined object, eventual validation
errors will be displayed in the gray box at the right of the interface.


Exporting an object for use in MONARC
-------------------------------------


MONARC will be able to handle the CSV or the JSON export.
