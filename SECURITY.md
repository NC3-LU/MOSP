# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Last stable version of the MOSP always provides security updates.
There will be no security patches for other releases (tagged or not).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you have found a potential security issue, do not open
directly a GitHub issue.
Please open a GitHub security advisory:
https://github.com/NC3-LU/MOSP/security

Or email us:
[opensource@nc3.lu](mailto:opensource@nc3.lu).

You can also specify how you would like to be credited for your finding
(commit message or release notes for the new release). We will
respect your privacy and will only publicize your involvement if you
grant us permission.
