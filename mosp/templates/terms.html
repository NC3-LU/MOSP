            <h2><a id="enforcement">Enforcement</a></h2>
            <p>The company may investigate and prosecute violations of these terms to the fullest legal extent.  The company may notify and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in prosecuting violations of the law and these terms.</p>
            <p>The company reserves the right to change, redact, and delete content on the website for any reason.  If you believe someone has submitted content to the website in violation of these terms, <a href="#contact">please contact us immediately</a>.</p>
            <h2><a id="your-account">Your Account</a></h2>
            <p>You must create and log into an account to use some features of the website.</p>
            <p>To create an account, you must <a href="#contact">contact us</a>. You do not have to provide an e-mail address, only a nickname. You may close your account at any time by e-mailing <a href="mailto:{{ config['ADMIN_EMAIL'] }}">{{ config['ADMIN_EMAIL'] }}</a> or via <a href="{{ url_for('user_bp.form') }}">your profile</a> page.</p>
            <p>You agree to be responsible for all action taken using your account, whether authorized by you or not, until you either close your account or notify the company that your account has been compromised.  You agree to notify the company immediately if you suspect your account has been compromised.  You agree to select a secure password for your account, and keep it secret.</p>
            <p>The company may restrict, suspend, or close your account on the website according to its policy for handling copyright-related takedown requests, or if the company reasonably believes that you’ve breached these terms.</p>
            <h2><a id="your-content">Your Content</a></h2>
            <p>Nothing in these terms gives the company any ownership rights in intellectual property that you share with the website, such as your account information or other content you submit to the website.  Nothing in these terms gives you any ownership rights in the company’s intellectual property, either.</p>
            <p>Between you and the company, you remain solely responsible for content you submit to the website.  You agree not to wrongly imply that content you submit to the website is sponsored or approved by the company.  These terms do not obligate the company to store, maintain, or provide copies of content you submit.</p>
            <p>Content you submit to the website belongs to you, and you decide what permission to give others for it.  But at a minimum, you license the company to provide content that you submit to the website to other users of the website.  That special license allows the company to copy, publish, and analyze content you submit to the website.</p>
            <p>When content you submit is removed from the website, whether by you or by the company, the company’s special license ends when the last copy disappears from the company’s backups, caches, and other systems.  Other licenses you apply to content you submit may continue after your content is removed.  Those licenses may give others, or the company itself, the right to share your content through the website again.</p>
            <p>Others who receive content you submit to the website may violate the terms on which you license your content.  You agree that the company will not be liable to you for those violations or their consequences.</p>
            <h2><a id="responsibility">Your Responsibility</a></h2>
            <p>You agree to indemnify the company from legal claims by others related to your breach of these terms, or breach of these terms by others using your account on the website.  Both you and the company agree to notify the other side of any legal claims for which you might have to indemnify the company as soon as possible.  If the company fails to notify you of a legal claim promptly, you won’t have to indemnify the company for damages that you could have defended against or mitigated with prompt notice.  You agree to allow the company to control investigation, defense, and settlement of legal claims for which you would have to indemnify the company, and to cooperate with those efforts.  The company agrees not to agree to any settlement that admits fault for you or imposes obligations on you without your prior agreement.</p>
            <h2><a id="disclaimers">Disclaimers</a></h2>
            <p><em><strong>You accept all risk of using the website and content on the website.  As far as the law allows, the company provides the website as is, without any warranty whatsoever.</strong></em></p>
            <p>The website may hyperlink to and integrate websites and services run by others.  The company does not make any warranty about services run by others, or content they may provide.  Use of services run by others may be governed by other terms between you and the one running service.</p>
            <h2><a id="liability">Limits on Liability</a></h2>
            <p><em><strong>The company will not be liable to you for breach-of-contract damages company personnel could not have reasonably foreseen when you agreed to these terms.</strong></em></p>
            <p><em><strong>As far as the law allows, the company’s total liability to you for claims of any kind that are related to the website or content on the website will be limited to $50.</strong></em></p>
            <h2><a id="feedback">Feedback</a></h2>
            <p>The company welcomes your feedback and suggestions for the website.  See the <a href="#contact">Contact</a> section below for ways to get in touch with us.</p>
            <p>You agree that the company will be free to act on feedback and suggestions you provide, and that the company won’t have to notify you that your feedback was used, get your permission to use it, or pay you.  You agree not to submit feedback or suggestions that you believe might be confidential or proprietary, to you or others.</p>
            <h2><a id="termination">Termination</a></h2>
            <p>Either you or the company may end the agreement written out in these terms at any time.  When our agreement ends, your permission to use the website also ends.</p>
            <p>The following provisions survive the end of our agreement: <a href="#your-content">Your Content</a>, <a href="#feedback">Feedback</a>, <a href="#responsibility">Your Responsibility</a>, <a href="#disclaimers">Disclaimers</a>, <a href="#limits-on-liability">Limits on Liability</a>, and <a href="#general">General Terms</a>.</p>
            <h2><a id="disputes">Disputes</a></h2>
            <p>Luxembourg law will govern any dispute, including any legal proceedings, related to these terms or your use of the website.</p>
            <p>Any arbitration award will include costs of the arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and reasonable costs for witnesses.  You or the company may enter arbitration awards in any court with jurisdiction.</p>
            <h2><a id="general">General Terms</a></h2>
            <p>If a provision of these terms is unenforceable as written, but could be changed to make it enforceable, that provision should be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.  Otherwise, that provision should be removed.</p>
            <p>You may not assign your agreement with the company.  The company may assign your agreement to any affiliate of the company, any other company that obtains control of the company, or any other company that buys assets of the company related to the website.  Any attempted assignment against these terms has no legal effect.</p>
            <p>Neither the exercise of any right under this Agreement, nor waiver of any breach of this Agreement, waives any other breach of this Agreement.</p>
            <p>These terms embody all the terms of agreement between you and the company about use of the website.  These terms entirely replace any other agreements about your use of the website, written or not.</p>
            <h2><a id="contact">Contact</a></h2>
            <p>You may notify the company under these terms, and send questions to the company, at <a href="mailto:{{ config['ADMIN_EMAIL'] }}">{{ config['ADMIN_EMAIL'] }}</a>.</p>
            <p>The company may notify you under these terms using the e-mail address you provide for your account on the website, or by posting a message to the homepage of the website or your account page.</p>
            <h2><a id="changes">Changes</a></h2>
            <p>The company last updated these terms on February 26, 2019, and may update these terms again.  The company will post all updates to the website.  For updates that contain substantial changes, the company agrees to e-mail you, if you’ve created an account and provided a valid e-mail address.  The company may also announce updates with special messages or alerts on the website.</p>
            <p>Once you get notice of an update to these terms, you must agree to the new terms in order to keep using the website.</p>
